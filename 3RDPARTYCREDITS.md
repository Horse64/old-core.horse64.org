======================================================

This file lists credits for software possibly used by Horse64 in its
runtime form, and therefore possibly integrated into any binary
produced by Horse64's `horsec` compiler.

It might be a good idea to publish this file with your Horse64-based
projects, either shipped as user-readable text file next to your
binaries or with its contents readable somewhere inside your program.
This is not legal advice, talk to your lawyer.
