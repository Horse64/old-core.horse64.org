GCC libstdc++
-------------

The source code is distributed under the GNU General
Public License version 3, with the addition under section 7
of an exception described in the “GCC Runtime Library Exception,
version 3.1” as follows (or see the file COPYING.RUNTIME):


GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

   A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
   Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
   interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
   on the Runtime Library.

   "GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
   modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
   the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
   subsequent versions published by the FSF.

   "GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
   modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
   the license of GCC.

   "Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
   target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
   input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
   phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
   format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
   for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

   The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
   non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
   Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
   use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
   part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
   understood as starting with the output of the generators or
   preprocessors.

   A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
   with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
   work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
   optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
   Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
   combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
   propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
   all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
   may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
   consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

   The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
   presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
   requirements of the license of GCC.
