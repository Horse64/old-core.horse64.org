Horse64 Licensing
-----------------

Horse64's core (as found in this repo) is largely made up of
**four parts**, which are:

- Part 1: project code (BSD-2-clause license),
- Part 2: 3rd party code (various, see below),
- Part 3: its documentation (CC-BY-SA 4.0 license),
- Part 4: its logo artwork (**proprietary**, see below).

The full licenses, or where to read them, are listed below.

*Note: we believe all of Horse64 other than the logo qualifies as
free software. However, to be certain, make sure to check this
claim for yourself if necessary. Don't sue us if we got this wrong.*


Horse64 Code License (Part 1)
-----------------------------

*Note: the Horse64 code is all subfolders of this repository
excluding 1. the Horse64 Logo with files found in `misc/`
(`misc/logo.svg` and others starting with "logo") and the logo files
possibly baked into the official binaries, and excluding 2.
third-party code found in `vendor/`, and excluding 3. the
documentation in `docs/`.*

Vendor / 3rd party licenses (Part 2)
------------------------------------

Please check [3RDPARTYCREDITS.md](3RDPARTYCREDITS.md), which attempts
to collect the licenses for projects used from `vendor/` for your
convenience. **The `3RDPARTYCREDITS.md` file may be incomplete or
outdated, please always refer to the original files in `vendor/` for
the full list.**


Horse64 Documentation License (Part 3)
--------------------------------------

The documentation, as found in the `docs/` folder and in the `README.md` file
in the repository root, is CC-BY-SA-4.0 licensed.
( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ )
It should be credited as `Copyright (C) 2020 Horse64 Team (See AUTHORS.md)`.


Horse64 Logo License (Part 4)
-----------------------------

Horse64 Logo is Copyright (C)  2020-2021, ellie/@ell1e. All Rights Reserved.

The "Horse64 Logo"'s files are located in `misc/` with the filenames starting
with "logo".
The Horse64 Logo and its files may only be used in the official, unmodified
"Horse64" as maintained by Ellie (currently at
`https://github.com/horse64`, and at `https://horse64.org/download`).
**If you distribute modified versions of Horse64, don't use
the Horse64 Logo and please don't use the official name "Horse64" either.**
Temporary forks only made for the personal use of preparing
pull requests for the official "Horse64" are fine, of course.
