Horse64
=======

Welcome to *Horse64*, an **elegant & comprehensive programming
language** for your applications.

[![logo](misc/logo-readme.png)](https://horse64.org)

```
func main {
    print("Hello World!")
}
```

**Features:**

- **Elegant.** Easy syntax with flexible dynamic typing,
  quick to get started in.

- **Cross-platform.** Supports Windows and Linux, with easy support
  feasible for any platform supporting OpenGL in the future.

- **Self-contained tooling.** Single-binary compiler, no complex
  toolchains or giant IDEs. (unless you want them)

- **Ready for big projects.** Checks incorrect identifiers,
  incorrect imports, all at at compile time.
  As such, Horse64 has compile checks often only in
  typed languages, like C# or TypeScript,
  combined with easy use of a Python or JavaScript.

- **Easy to ship.** Single-binary output. No need to include an interpreter
  or separate libaries, making it suitable for cloud & micro service use.

- **Multimedia included.** The runtime supports 3D via OpenGL, and
  2D UIs out of the box.

- **Open.** *Horse64* is, excluding its logo, all free software
  under BSD-like licensing. [Check the license here.](LICENSE.md)

- **Stability.** Horse64 comes with comfortable garbage-collection,
  giving you stability without manual hand-holding.

Advanced: Build it Yourself
---------------------------

Since Horse64 is [open-source](LICENSE.md), you can
[build it yourself by following the custom build instructions.](
https://horse64.org/INVALID-LINK-FIXME)
Please note this is an advanced task and in no way necessary to
make your application.
However, if you want to contribute to Horse64's compiler,
this might be your first step to enable you to do so.
