Welcome to the *Horse64* language.

[![logo](misc/logo-readme.png)](https://horse64.org)

```
func main {
    print("Hello World, from Horse64!")
}
```

You found a **simple & versatile high level language** for backends, mobile,
and desktop programs. *Horse64*'s [design](./docs/Design.md#overview) is
focused on improving handling in large projects compared to scripting
languages like Python, while retaining their ease of use. [Try it
yourself!](https://horse64.org/download)

*Horse64* is, excluding its logo, all free software
under BSD-2-clause licensing. [Check the license here.](LICENSE.md)
We also have an open [specification](./docs/Specification/Horse64.md).

Advanced: Build it Yourself
---------------------------

Since Horse64 is [open-source](LICENSE.md), you can
[build it yourself](
    ./docs/horsec/horsec.md#manual-build   
) if you want to. However, it is recommended you simply
use the [prebuilt SDK](https://horse64.org/download).
