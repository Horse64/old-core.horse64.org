Horse64
=======

Welcome to *Horse64*, an **elegant & comprehensive programming
language** for your applications.

[![logo](misc/logo-readme.png)](https://horse64.org)

```
func main {
    print("Hello World!")
}
```

**Features:**

- **Elegant.** Easy syntax, dynamic typing, quick to get started.

- **Self-contained tooling.** Single-binary compiler, outputs your
  program as a single binary. No complex toolchains,
  or giant IDEs (unless you want them).

- **Suitable for big projects.** Checks incorrect identifiers,
  incorrect imports, in all dependencies at compile time.
  As such, Horse64 combines in-advance checks often only found in
  typed languages, like C# or TypeScript,
  with the untyped simplicity found in Python or JavaScript.

- **Easy to ship.** Single-binary output means you don't need to
  figure out how to include an interpreter or pre-install libraries
  yourself.

- **Cross-platform.** Supports Windows and Linux, with easy support
  feasible for any platform supporting OpenGL in the future.

- **Multimedia included.** The runtime supports 3D via OpenGL, and
  2D UIs out of the box.

- **Open.** *Horse64* is, excluding its logo, all free software
  under BSD-like licensing. [Check the license here.](LICENSE.md)

Advanced: Build it Yourself
---------------------------

Since Horse64 is [open-source](LICENSE.md), you can
[build it yourself by following the custom build instructions.](
https://horse64.org/INVALID-LINK-FIXME)
Please note this is an advanced task and in no way necessary to
make your application.
However, if you want to contribute to Horse64's compiler,
this might be your first step to enable you to do so.
