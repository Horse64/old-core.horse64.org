# Community Guidelines

When you participate in the Horse64 Community, please keep these
guidelines in mind:

- Please try to remain friendly, even when you perceive others to
  be wrong, since everyone is human.

- Don't discriminate based on race, gender, age, disabilities,
  appearance, ethnicity, financial means, or similar. Don't single
  out people for the purpose of putting them down.
  We have no place for this in our community.

- Don't use threats, deliberate intimidation, inappropiate sexual
  remarks, stalking, and similar, to make people uncomfortable.
  If in doubt, please err on the side of inclusion and making people
  feel safe and welcome even during disagremeents.

These guidelines apply as a minimum on all official bug trackers,
and any other place for official Horse64-related communication
like the chatrooms, as well as any official events.


## What if things go wrong?

If you want to report any questionable behavior in Horse64-related
communities, for example the bug trackers, community chat, or similar,
please approach a [moderator in the official Matrix chatroom](
  https://matrix.to/#/#horse64:matrix.org
) using a "Direct message".
We will try to help you out as best as we can to resolve the
situation, and to enforce the guidelines where needed.

If you want to give general organizational feedback, or bring
up other public issues including related to these guidelines, please
head to the [horse64 organizational discussion repo](
https://github.com/horse64/horse64-general).
