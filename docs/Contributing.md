# Contributing to Horse64

If you want to contribute to Horse64, there are multiple tasks you
may want to help out with. Please note that you are expected to
keep the [Community Guidelines](./Community%20Guidelines.md) in mind
while participating.


## Report Bugs

You can help find issues in [horsec](./horsec/horsec.md) and other
tooling by testing interesting corner cases, verifying with this
documentation and other community members that it is likely a bug,
and then **report the issue:**

- [core.horse64.org Bug Tracker (for horsec/horsevm core bugs)](
     https://github.com/horse64/core.horse64.org/issues/
  )
- [multimedia.horse64.org Bug Tracker](
     https://github.com/horse64/multimedia.horse64.org/issues/
  )

For other issues, please locate the bug tracker of the respective
package or project. If it isn't about a specific package,
use the [general bug tracker](https://github.com/horse64/horse64-general).

Don't forget the [guidelines](./Community%20Guidelines.md)
when filing tickets, and to check for duplicate tickets that
were already filed!
