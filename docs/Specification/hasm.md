# hasm bytecode

The `horse assembler` bytecode language is what is used by the
builtin [horsevm](../Misc%20Tooling/horsevm.md). There is currently
no specification available, but you can find the implementation
in the [core package sources](
    ../Contributing.md#core.horse64.org-source
) inside the `horse64/bytecode.h` file.
