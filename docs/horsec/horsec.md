# HorseC / Compiler

The `horsec` program allows you to compile Horse64 source
code to binaries. The source code can be found in the
[core.horse64.org repository](
    ../Contributing.md#corehorse64org-package
) inside the `horse64/compiler/` folder.


## Get it

`horsec` is part of the [official SDK](../Introduction.md#download).


## How does it work

If you think you found a bug then please check this full
documentation carefully and possibly consult with community
members. If that confirms you likely found a bug,
[report it to get it fixed](../Contributing.md#report-bugs).
